## Problem 1

```{r}
trash_data = read_excel(
  path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:N408") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. For each, omit rows without precipitation data and add a variable year. Next, combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).
