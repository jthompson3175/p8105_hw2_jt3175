## Problem 1

Read and cleaned Mr.Â Trash Wheel data.

``` r
trash_data = read_excel(
  path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:N408") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

Read and cleaned precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. Rows without
precipitation data were omitted and a variable was added for year.

``` r
precip_2017 = read_excel(
  path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
  sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)

precip_2018 = read_excel(
  path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
  sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

Combined precipitation datasets and converted month to a character
variable.

``` r
precip_data = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
  names_from = year,
  values_from = total) %>% 
  rename("total_precip_2017" = "2017", "total_precip_2018" = "2018") %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[]
  )
```
